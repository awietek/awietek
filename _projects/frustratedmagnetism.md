title: Frustrated Magnetism
description: Frustrated magnets are systems where local magnetic moments cannot be properly aligned at low temperatures. The resulting strong fluctuations can cause the system to stabilize exotic states of matter. This includes several (chiral) spin liquids and valence bond solids, for which I have demonstrated that they can emerge in rather simple Heisenberg antiferromagnets.

  The mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity are yet to be
  fully understood. The idea of electron-holes traveling in a
  background of strongly fluctuating magnetic moments has been
  proposed early as one of the most promising
  explanations <d-cite key="Anderson1987"></d-cite>. The fluctuating background
  spins have been envisioned to form an exotic state of matter, a
  so-called quantum spin liquid<d-cite key="Anderson1987,Wen1989a"></d-cite>.
  Although quantum spin liquids have been proposed in the late 1980s,
  until very recently no simple model realizing this exotic physics
  has been known.  Advances in numerical methods solved this problem
  around 2015. Using a combination of exact diagonalization and
  Gutzwiller projected ansatz wave functions I was among the first
  to show conclusive evidence for the emergence of a chiral spin
  liquid state in simple antiferromagnetic Heisenberg models on the
  kagome and triangular
  lattice <d-cite key="Wietek2015,Wietek2017a,Nataf2016"></d-cite>. Different
  groups also confirmed my findings using the density matrix
  renormalization group (DMRG) method <d-cite key="Gong2017"></d-cite>. Recently,
  we also discovered another kind of chiral spin liquid in a simple
  model with SU(3) degrees of freedom on the square lattice by a
  combination af various methods<d-cite key="Chen2020"></d-cite>
  and a diamond valence bond solid in the kagome lattice<d-cite key="Wietek2020a"></d-cite>.
