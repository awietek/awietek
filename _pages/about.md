I'm a computational physicist working in the field of condensed matter and quantum many-body physics. I am interested in the way quantum particles, like electrons or atoms, organize themselves while interacting with one another. This way, I aim at understanding how the macroscopic behavior of materials, like various forms of magnetism or superconductivity, emerges. Besides trying to explain existing experimental phenomena in solid-state physics, I investigate under which circumstances entirely new states of matter, like quantum spin liquids, can occur.

To solve these questions, I am developing numerical technology to simulate quantum many-body systems. The quantum many-body problem is considered to be exponentially hard in the number of particles. One approach I am pursuing is to push the limits of exact simulations by developing high-performance computing software and distributed parallel algorithms for quantum many-body systems. More recently, I am embracing tensor network methods to reduce the computational complexity by representing data efficiently. If you would like to find out more about my research, please have a look at my research page or contact me.
