I'm a computational physicist working in the field of condensed matter and quantum many-body physics. I am interested in the way quantum particles, like electrons or atoms, organize themselves while interacting with one another. This way, I aim at understanding how the macroscopic behavior of materials, like various forms of magnetism or superconductivity, emerges. Besides trying to explain existing experimental phenomena in solid-state physics, I investigate under which circumstances entirely new states of matter, like quantum spin liquids, can occur.

To solve these questions, I am developing numerical technology to simulate quantum many-body systems. The quantum many-body problem is considered to be exponentially hard in the number of particles. One approach I am pursuing is to push the limits of exact simulations by developing high-performance computing software and distributed parallel algorithms for quantum many-body systems. More recently, I am embracing tensor network methods to reduce the computational complexity by representing data efficiently. If you would like to find out more about my research, please have a look at my research page or contact me. 


***Seeking Ph.D. candidates***

Interested in pursuing a research career in computational quantum many-body physics? I am hiring a Ph.D. student at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in the beautiful city of Dresden. Research topics range from exotic quantum phases of matter and superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems and frustrated quantum magnets to tensor network algorithms and high-performance computing for quantum systems. For a more detailed overview of the research pursued, see the [Research](projects.md) and [Publications](publications.md) section on this website.

* Requirements
  - Completed undergraduate studies in physics, computer science or mathematics (in the form of a M.Sc. of B.Sc. depending on the country of origin)
  - eagerness to explore the physics of strongly correlated quantum systems
  - eagerness to learn and advance modern computational techniques for quantum many-body physics

* Application material
  - your CV
  - a letter of motivation
  - one or two letters of reference from previous supervisors or lecturers

Please submit your application via email to [awietek@pks.mpg.de](mailto:awietek@pks.mpg.de).
